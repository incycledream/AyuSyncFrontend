    <p>
      This official AyuSync Server is a service for those who want to support
      our work. We spent a big amount of time on this project, so we'd
      appreciate any donations.
      <br />
      ...but if you want it free - go and host it by yourself. *pouts*, *pouts*,
      *pouts*.
      <br />
      Still, even if you're hosting your own version, please support us with a
      coin. (╥﹏╥)
      <br />
      Here's the self-hosted version:

    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="font-bold">Can I abuse it by creating new accounts?</p>
    <p>Yes, you can. <i>But do you really want to?</i></p>
    <br />
    <p class="font-bold">How much does it cost?</p>
    <p>As much as you want, starting from 1$. <br /></p>
    <br />
